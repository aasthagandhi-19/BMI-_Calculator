# BMI_Calculator
This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user enters their weight in kilograms and height in centimeters, and the app calculates their BMI and displays the result along with a health category — such as Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese.

It’s a quick and responsive tool to help users become more aware of their health status based on standard BMI classification.
